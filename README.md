# if-ifElse
This script is a beginner friendly Bash program. <br />
It prompts the user to input their age. If the user is older than 18, it outputs "You are an adult". If the user is less than 18, it outputs "You are underage". <br />
The script uses a basic "if" statement to make this determination and provides a simple way to categorize the users based on their age.
